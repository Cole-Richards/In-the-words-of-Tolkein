  a. Find all public domain works of Oscar Wilde 
  b. Using common NLP practices, grab the bag of words. 

Second: Get the bag of words from The Book of John from the New Testament. 
  a. Find an open source copy of The Book of John from the same time period 
  b. Grab the bag of words 

Third: Link these bags of words to a dictionary 
  a. See if Dictionary.com has an accessible API  

Fourth: Have a bag of words for each word 
  a. Create a database of words with their bags for both texts 

Fifth: Substite words in The Book of John that have the most similar bag of words definition from Wilde
