# In-the-words-of-Oscar-Wilde
This repo aims to translate a given text into the language of Oscar Wilde

This is where I will log the steps needed. I expect them to change based on my understanding of the coding challenge posed. 

First: Get the bag of words from the works of Mr. Wilde
  a. Find all public domain works of Oscar Wilde
  b. Using common NLP practices, grab the bag of words.
Second: Get the bag of words from The Book of John from the New Testament.
  a. Find an open source copy of The Book of John from the same time period
  b. Grab the bag of words
Third: Link these bags of words to a dictionary
  a. See if Dictionary.com has an accessible API 
Fourth: Have a bag of words for each word
  a. Create a database of words with their bags for both texts
Fifth: Substite words in The Book of John that have the most similar bag of words definition from Tolkein
